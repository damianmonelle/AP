- **main.py**: The refactoring process focused on improving the readability and maintainability of the code. This was achieved by reordering the imports, adding whitespace for visual separation of code blocks, and improving the naming of variables and methods. Also, the use of constants was replaced with more descriptive string literals to enhance understandability.
- **README.md**: The refactored content presents a more structured and detailed changelog. Each file update is categorized under its respective file with the date of the update clearly stated.
